# CRM - Web Application

A RESTAPI to make GET, POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP requests to a Mongo database of customers' information.<br>
<br>
To Run this application, you need to have Node.js installed first.<br>
Here I have used MongoDB as a database to store the data.<br>
Download and install the MongoDB Enterprise Edition as per your OS.<br>
If you are a Windows user, MongoDB keeps on running as service after you have installed it.<br>
For linux and Mac Users, you have to explicitly start the Mongo server after installing it.<br><br>
After installing the basic stuff, lets install the dependencies for this application which are as follows : <br>
body-parser<br>
express<br>
lodash<br>
mongodb<br>
nodemon(optional)<br>
All of these external modules can be easily installed via npm.<br><br>
Also you need to install some developer dependencies like : <br>
babel-cli<br>
babel-preset-env<br>
babel-preset-stage-0<br>
<br>
